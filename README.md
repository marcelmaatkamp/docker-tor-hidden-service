# Docker Tor Hidden Service with Client Authorization.

Added functionality from https://github.com/cmehay/docker-tor-hidden-service to create a tor hidden service with client authorization enabled (see _HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient_ in the tor manual).

## Setup

Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the services. In this case a `hello`-service and a `hidden`-service which makes hello container a hidden service:
```yaml
version: '2'
services:

 hello:
  image: "tutum/hello-world"
  hostname: "hello"

 tor:
# image: goldy/tor-hidden-service
  build: "docker-tor-hidden-service/"
  links:
   - "hello"
  environment:
   HELLO_PORTS: "80:80"
   HELLO_AUTH: "0123456789"
  volumes:
   - "tor:/var/lib/tor/hidden_service"

volumes:
 tor: 
```

The key to add to your `torrc` file in the tor browser can be extracted from the logfile when the hidden service starts:
```
tor_1    | Entrypoint INFO     hello: uifjb4bmt2ilpa2v.onion T3GgNOwr5ML5s5FGZsJ/CR # client: 0123456789:80

```

Add it to the `torrc` file like this:
```
HidServAuth uifjb4bmt2ilpa2v.onion T3GgNOwr5ML5s5FGZsJ/CR hello
```
